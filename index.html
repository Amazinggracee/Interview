                <p>I am Amarachi Dimkpa, Front-End Developer. 
                    I gained my knowledge through various websites and community platforms. 
                    Is a journey I started since 2018 and it has been a wonderful journey
                    With the help of www.freecodecamp.org, www.elotidesigns.com, and many other websites 
                    like w3school, foolish developer, etc.

                <h1> HOME</h1>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li><h4>Tell me about yourself.</h4><br>
                        I am a positive, enthusiastic and competent Web Developer who, over the years, 
                        has built up a diverse range of skills, qualities and attributes that guarantee I will 
                        perform highly in this role. I have experience working both alone and as part of a 
                        team. I take my work as a Web Developer seriously and this means 
                        I always ensure my skills are kept up to date within this rapidly changing industry. 
                        If you hire me as your Web Developer, I assure you I will fit into your team quickly, 
                        I will always put the commercial needs of your business at the forefront of everything 
                        I do, and the work I carry out will be consistent to a first-class standard.
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>What is your greatest strength?</h4><br>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><h5>Curiosity</h5>It pushes me to learn new languages, experiment, and look for new solutions.</li>
                            <li><h5>Technical skills</h5>Fashion art and programming are similar in the sense that
                            you have to work with a design and with a very good color combination that will meet the client's test.
                            Greatness doesn’t come from technical skills alone. However, you can’t expect exceptional 
                            results from people who don’t have the right skills for the job. You should think of skills as one of the elements of the puzzle which doesn’t do much in isolation. 
                            It can do wonders when accompanied by other developer strengths</li>
                            <li><h5>Love of learning</h5>You have to love the fundamental practice of going from not knowing to knowing, every single day” 
                                otherwise you won’t be good at it. This holds especially true in the world of IT. While it’s useful to have your way of doing things, it’s essential you venture out of what you know. Find faster ways of getting things done. 
                                One of the ways to do that is by noticing patterns and drawing conclusions.</li>
                            <li><h5>A positive attitude</h5>One of the qualities of a good programmer is that they solve problems day in and day out, 
                                but that doesn’t mean they should dwell on them. When tasks and tickets tend to pile up I try to wear a good attitude.
                                And I always have this in mind that everyone is facing one challenge or the other, we all need this challenge to grow.  </li>
                            <li><h5>Embracing mentorship</h5>In my country we have this slang "follow who knows the road". 
                                It simply takes less time to figure things out if you can watch a more seasoned colleague at work. Another reason why top techies advocate mentorship is because it requires you to expose both your strengths and weaknesses. 
                                This teaches you volumes about keeping your ego in check. </li>
                            <li><h5>Communication skills</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>You need to know what questions to ask when you don’t understand or need to double-check</li>
                                <li>It’s possible to figure things out based on communication with colleagues. That means you don’t need to rely on written specifications.</li>
                                <li>Concepts are understood and communicated quickly in a team of successful developers.</li>
                                <li>One of the qualities of a good programmer is that they can communicate cogently with both technical and non-technical staff.</li>
                            </ul></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>What is your greatest weakness?</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><h5>I have a hard time letting go of a project</h5>
                                I spent a great deal of time and effort on something, 
                                it’s easy to feel apprehensive about marking it complete or passing it to another team. 
                                There’s always room for improvement and I tend to over-criticize my work or 
                                attempt last-minute changes, which can threaten the timeline.</li>
                            <li><h5>I sometimes lack confidence</h5>
                                Lack of confidence is one of my weakness, especially as an entry-level contributors. However, 
                                having a lack of confidence can sometimes cause inefficiencies in my work. Though
                                , I have this strong believe that the more projects I venture into the more confident I will be become.</li>
                            <li><h5>I focus too much on the details</h5>
                                Being detail-oriented is typically a good thing, but if you’re someone who 
                                tends to spend too much time on the specifics 
                                of a project like me, it could also be considered a weakness. Is one of the habits I developed 
                            from also being a fashion designer. You have to get it right.</li>
                           
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <ol type="1">
                    <li><h5>Why should we hire you?</h5>
                        As a junior in tech world, I know that what I'm lacking is career experience. 
                        However, the qualifications that I bring cannot be measured by traditional experience. 
                        After holding offices in fashion organization and managing a full course load of programming languages
                        with my job as a fashion designer and tailor, I learned how to multitask and prioritize 
                        responsibilities. In your fast-paced organization, 
                        the ability to effectively prioritize is a significant component of the success we recorded in my organization.</li>
                    <li><h5>Why do you want to work here?</h5>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>“I’m very passionate about technology and would be thrilled to work for 
                                an organization that subscribes to the same core values...</li>
                            <li>I’ve always loved to do any work that has to do with designs. 
                                From my days at the college, I did my industrial training in a newspaper media, 
                                I worked on as an intern, networking to be precise  — 
                                so I’m excited to see that coding is a big part of this job.</li>
                            <li>I can see myself succeeding in this position because I’ve done similar work in the past and know what 
                                it takes to engage these particular consumers.</li>
                        </ol></li>

        <section class="section2">
            <div id="work">
                <h1>WORK</h1>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you showed leadership.</h5>
                        I think that strong organizational skills are some of the most important for a leader 
                        to have. My community has an annual fashion show, and the person who used to organize 
                        and recruit people and make sure all hands are on deck is me. Is a kind of competition for 
                        all the fashion designers. Since I’d helped them in the 
                        past, I volunteered to run it this year. It’s a potluck event and we usually have a few 
                        organized activities throughout the day. I made sure all the design and fabrics for the designs are
                        ready . At a time I have beg my colleague to work all night with me because making clothes especially
                        the ones for competition can be time consuming having in mind that someone is also working very
                        hard to out shine you and your group.</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you were successful on a team.</h5>
                        I have built some mini websites with HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript with Freecodecamp, Codedamn, 
                        Eloti Designs, and a few coding challenges with the collaboration of some Microverse incoming students.
                        I also managed a Fashion and Design workshop from 2015 to date.

                    </li>
                    <li><h5>What would your co-workers say about you?</h5>
                        My coworkers would describe me as an organized, 
                        thoughtful person who works well under pressure. So much of what I enjoy about doing 
                        design work is creating a well-organized environment and anticipating the needs 
                        of my coworkers to make office life run as smoothly as possible. My colleagues regularly 
                        comment on my positive attitude 
                        and problem-solving abilities when we get a difficult client.</li>
                    <li><h5>Why do you want to leave your current role?</h5>
                        My biggest reason for leaving is that I'm ready to take on more responsibility. 
                        I want to be a programmer, It has been my long time dream. With rapid change of direction towards
                        technology, I have to acquire this skill. IT has actually stood the test of time, swallowing every
                        other industries. I am a fashion designer and I know how much we depend on tech.</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities.</h5>
                        Well, I recently had to decide between fashion and design or web/app development carrier.
                        So I decided I would do both. 
                        I will continue with fashion but on a very low key, i will just make my clothes 
                        and also for very close
                        relatives, then I would come home to study.
                        Win, win, right? No, it didn not work out for me. 
                        I finally found my way back home and started studying and 
                        I know what you might be thinking, don't worry I just reset my priority now. I do
                        my web/app first while I use my sewing as a break for my brain since I don't have to 
                        think too much or learn much new thing in my fashion world. 
                        So I can clearly multitask my priorities</li>
                    <li><h5>In next five years, I would see myself as a person with more knowledge and experience and look for new opportunities which will improve my skills and enhance my knowledge 
                        I think that working in your organization will improve my experience and expertise</h5></li>
                    <li><h5>Describe your leadership style.</h5>
                        I would describe my leadership style as direct, and leading by example. 
                        I enjoy delegating tasks and taking the lead on projects, 
                        but I also like to stay involved and inspire my 
                        team by showing that I’m working hands-on to help them, too. For example, in my fashion world,
                        you have to carry everybody along, share the task, let Mrs A prepare the band while Mrs B handle
                        the blouse. With both the leader and those being lead working in harmony, time is saved.</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake</h5>
                        I was managing a project for one of our client who has already booked her flight for summer vacation , 
                        and I was so eager to please her that I told her we could finish the project 
                        within 2 weeks. I thought this was doable, but it ended up taking three weeks and 
                        she was not happy. Looking back, I realized I should have been more conservative 
                        in my estimate to the client. I realized that a client isn’t going to 
                        be upset if you’re clear about the timeline in advance, but they are going to
                         be disappointed if you promise something and then don’t deliver. So I took this 
                         experience and used it to become much better at managing the expectations of clients 
                         during projects I oversee.</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult person.</h5>
                        Next project with a different client, 
                        I told them it’d take four weeks and we finished in three. They were very happy about this</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you had to persuade someone.</h5>
                        In the fashion world, competition is real. 
                        Because that happens to me all the time! I spend a lot of time trying 
                        to get others to see my point of view, especially on body size issue. 
                        It’s amazing how many ignorant people there are in this world. 
                        So I spend a lot of time trying to make a client to accept that the style 
                        she wants is not going to fit her shape. It takes time, but I am hoping that over 
                        time my comments will finally ring true with just one or two people. 
                        If I can convert even one or two people over to my point of view, well, 
                        then it’s all worth it.</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone.</h5>
                        A colleague believed that it was my fault that we'd missed our deadline. 
                        I suggested that we sat and discussed the issue. Through discussion, 
                        we came to a mutual understanding that there were 
                        several factors involved in pushing the project over the deadline and 
                        that we both contributed.</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you created a goal and achieved it.</h5>
                        In my recent internship, I set a personal goal to not only accomplish my set objectives 
                        for my internship, but also to develop proficiency in a new tool or technology. 
                        My objectives for my internship were both completed and I was also able to develop 
                        proficiency in quite number of programming languges.</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you surpassed people’s expectations.</h5>
                        Going above and beyond in my position is something I enjoy. It makes the clients feel special, and it helps our business. I regularly call clients to check in with them and see how they are doing, even if there are no issues with the service they received. This is not required by my company or supervisor, but I think going above and beyond our customer's expectations by keeping in 
                        touch with them helps to build lasting relationships that keep the 
                        clients loyal to our business.</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you had to handle pressure.</h5>
                        Throughout my career, I have done some of my best work under pressure. 
                        I find that routine makes us complacent, and I am always 
                        looking for challenges that push me to give my best and to quickly come up 
                        with working solutions.</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly.</h5>
                        Recently, I was faced with a project that had to do with React JS. 
                        I had to learn the program using websites and youtube videos .

                    <li><h5>Describe your most challenging project.</h5>
                        So far, I think the biggest project I completed was at University website. It took me 1 week to complete it, 
                        .I learnt alot from it. in short is my first full website. You can check it here https://github.com/Amazinggracee/College.
                        That was one the greatest projects i have worked on so far.</li>
                    <li><h5>Tell me about something you’ve accomplished that you are proud of.</h5>
                        As a recent Web developer, I have limited professional experience, 
                        so my greatest accomplishment has to be learning Programming language and being able to code 
                        some meaninful apps with what I have learnt so far. At the beginning of 2018, I was apprehensive 
                        about going into Tech world, always under rating my ability to understand the code syntax.

                        This experience taught me the value of asking for help from others because as soon as I 
                        communicated my interests to a friend of mine called Google, I was able to design with html5 and a little css. 
                        Then, April 2022, I joined elotidesigns, she became my teacher and my mentor.
